# boston-housing

First Project for Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree.

This project is designed to get me acquainted with the many techniques for training, testing, evaluating, and optimizing models, available in sklearn. 

The dataset for this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978.
